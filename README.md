bookmarklets
============

A collection of JavaScript Bookmarklets

This is a project I'm using to learn JavaScript, Git and GitHub.  

All code is free to be studied, used, copied, remade, transformed or distributed.  Credit is nice, but not required.  

You can see the [finished bookmarklets](http://carenewaterman.github.io/bookmarklets) on my project page which I'll update as I'm happy with each one.  You can simply drag the bookmarklet to your toolbar or folder to use it.

The code for each bookmarklet is available here in an expanded readable form and a compressed, minified and partially escaped form which is what is used to form the URL for the bookmarklet.

All bookmarklets are developed in Firefox, tested in Chromium and Opera (current stable version) and likely will not work in older versions of Internet Explorer.  I have no access to any version of IE for testing.
